17,Ash,However... it was Dom who had been captured by the very target he was tasked to kill.
18,Ash,A sin unforgivable to the Scoria.
19,Ash,So it fell to Pilio the lesser to uphold the Scoria by taking Doms life.
20,Ash,By this the Seven would have assurance that Doms flaw was not a... familial trait.
21,Ash,You see as you might expect of an Orokin school of murder the Scoria were ruthless when it came to... academic excellence.
22,Ash,With Dom dead at Pilios feet two essential killings would have taken place that of a failure and that of any shred of pity within Pilio.
23,Ash,Ash would oversee Pilios mission.
24,Ash,Pilios soul was to die that day as the life drained from his brothers eyes or if he could not do so beneath the blades of his lifelong idol Ash.
25,Ash,Coils of red Martian dust trailed tongues from the dark metal of Ashs Edo epaulets.
26,Ash,The boy idolized the Warframe and was eager to prove himself even as some part of him felt cold and afraid at what he must do.
27,Ash,Doubt is betrayal taught the Scoria.
28,Ash,Pilio recited this but could not quench the fear he felt.
29,Ash,Fear of what he must do... and fear of what his hero and idol would do to him should his faith fail.
30,Ash,Ash gave the signal.
31,Ash,Pilio shot forward in a bold unconventional Dying Vine pattern reading the Scoriafavored Dust Fang technique.
32,Ash,The tower guards squinted into the amber light of the Martian sunrise as a flashcloud of smoke flooded the lane before them.
33,Ash,Shaking sleep from their heads and still thinking of breakfast the guards readied themselves.
34,Ash,From the smoke flew stars.
35,Ash,The boy berated himself this weakness this disgust.
36,Ash,Touching the symbol of his order the smokegem between his eyes he muttered a prayer for strength.
37,Ash,Stepping over the carpet of bodies Ash crept into the courtyard knowing full well the fiftystrong house guard would show itself in force.
38,Ash,With a sudden clatter reinforcements lined the courtyard walls balconies...
39,Ash,The Scoria had a saying You are immortal.
40,Ash,One mistake makes that otherwise.
41,Ash,Ash had never made a mistake.
42,Ash,Here were fifty.
43,Ash,With one swift movement the Warframe swatted the boy into cover unslung his Causta bow and sprang into a flawless grey chrysanthemum combat solution.
44,Ash,Shame reddened Pilios face as the courtyard lit noonbright with the glare of a halfhundred muzzle flashes his blade dry in his hand.
45,Ash,Bodies rained into the courtyard.
46,Ash,Wincing the boy looked away.
47,Ash,Within minutes fifty corpses lay at their feet.
48,Ash,When Pilio felt Ashs shadow fall across him he forced himself to look trembling.
49,Ash,Ashs inscrutable gaze pinned him.
50,Ash,Chest tight breath terrified and quick Pilio forced himself to stand and face his assessor.
51,Ash,He could not look at the bodies.
52,Ash,Truthfully he expected to die where he stood.
53,Ash,If the Warframe approved or disapproved he gave no sign.
54,Ash,Rather Ash opened an arm showing the way toward Pilios final trial.
55,Ash,And with him Dom in civilian clothes... sharing a glass of aged claret.
56,Ash,Pain cracked through Pilios brain the smokegem between his eyes flashing hot Sudden images of sunlight.
57,Ash,Vineyards.
58,Ash,A womans face.
59,Ash,The gem burned as it pushed these images away.
60,Ash,A young man with grand mustaches smiling and saying Of all the sons I could have had Im glad it was you two.
61,Ash,Pain Dom leapt to his feet urging his brother to hear what the target had to say but Pilio saw only the scabbedover divot between Doms eyes where a black jewel had once rested.
62,Ash,Dom had turned his back on the order.
63,Ash,Why Why had he done this The mustachioed man leapt to Doms defense snatching his sidearm from beneath his ironwood desk a foolish mistake.
64,Ash,Ash split into impossible multiples.
65,Ash,The man opened fire on the three before being seized from behind by the fourth.
66,Ash,Ashs illusory clones vanished.
67,Ash,The weapon clattered to the polished wooden floor even as his feet left it dangling three feet above helplesss those sad kind eyes locked on Pilios in a regretful farewell.
68,Ash,Ask the Warframe Dom said He knows exactly why.
69,Ash,Fear filled Pilios heart.
70,Ash,Pilio turned to his idol that saint of murder.
71,Ash,The same question but this time for Ash why That moment of breathtaking impudence stretched for an eternity.
72,Ash,Ash released his grip.
73,Ash,His prisoner flopped to the floor gasping.
74,Ash,With one great hand Ash reached toward Pilios face... and sank a vicious talon beneath that midnight jewel.
75,Ash,Pilio screamed.
76,Ash,Blood flowed.
77,Ash,The gem flew free with a nauseating pop cracking against the wall to die in a weak plume of rancid smoke.
78,Ash,Blinding white insight descended upon Pilio DeNas.
79,Ash,Everything the black gem had walled off within his mind was now laid bare.
80,Ash,The Scoria had stolen the sons of Lio DeNas.
81,Ash,Lio DeNas kindeyed Lio DeNas was stealing them back.
82,Ash,Of all the sons I could have had Im glad it was you two.
83,Ash,Father and son beheld each other truly for the first time in almost twenty years.
84,Ash,Pilio had longaspired to wearing the Edo armor the highest honor to signify his faith but now he saw only the bare ribs of Ashs Cremata syandana signifier of death and knew with certainty that was the sole credo of the faith he had followed.
85,Ash,Had.
86,Ash,The boy who until that moment had thought himself a lifelong killer was now torn between the nocturnal life he thought he knew and the sunlit life he had been stolen from.
87,Ash,Torn between Doctrine and family.
88,Ash,And blade in hand torn between saving himself by killing his brother... or dying alongside him at the hand of his idol.
89,Ash,Ash waited patient as the death he signified in a room in a moment that felt suspended in eternity.
90,Ash,Waiting for Pilios decision.
91,Ash,The blade fell from Pilios hand.
92,Ash,Dom reached out and gently took that hand.
93,Ash,Ash did not move.
94,Ash,Lio DeNas swept his boys up and out of that room and as a family they fled the Tower the city and Mars forever.
95,Ash,Ash did not move.
96,Ash,What are we to make of this Why did Ash focal figure of the Scoria go against Doctrine and permit two boys who were both failures and traitors to fly free What was it this killer saw in two nearorphans that shall we say softened his heart We do not know.
97,Ash,Neither did Pilio whose memoirs bring us this story.
98,Ash,But.
99,Ash,We do know this in the final days of Orokin rule... as towers fell and death came for the whiteandgold gods... the Scoria were not spared.
100,Ash,No.
101,Ash,Rather their senior ranks the mentors and chief assassins were exterminated to a figure in a pogrom of ruthless and breathtaking efficiency.
102,Ash,A neartotal destruction led... in the main... by Ash.
103,Ash,Curious no During the Orokin Era there was a school of assassination called the Scoria.
104,Ash,Each of its members bore a black jewel imprinted between their eyes and treated Ash as their patron saint.
105,Ash,At one point during the Era the school had two noteworthy students brothers Dom and Pilio DeNas.
106,Ash,Dom possessed great skill while Pilio was not as gifted lacking his brothers grace and clarity but one day Dom was captured by his target.
107,Ash,As capture by the enemy was considered an unforgivable sin to the Scoria Pilio was given the task to assassinate his brother a mission that would be overseen by Ash himself.
108,Ash,However Pilio would be torn from killing his brother were he to succeed or being killed by his idol were he to fail.
109,Ash,The pair was dispatched on a tower located in Martialis Mars but Pilio failed to overcome the fear that his task wrought leaving Ash to slay the fifty guardsmen with his Causta Bow and Dual Kamas.
110,Ash,Ash led Pilio to their targets chambers discovering Dom in civilian clothes casually sharing a glass of wine with a middleaged mustachioed man his eyes both sad and kind.
111,Ash,The gem between Doms eyes was removed signifying that he had betrayed the Scoria.
112,Ash,The man gladly called Dom and Pilio his sons before coming to Doms defense and brandishing a sidearm which was quickly disarmed by Ashs Blade Storm.
113,Ash,Urged by Dom a confused Pilio questioned Ash who responded by sinking his blade into Pilios gem.
114,Ash,The gem was suppressing the memories of Dom and Pilio DeNas who were stolen by the Scoria.
115,Ash,The mustachioed man Lio DeNas was stealing back his sons.
116,Ash,Ash had saved the boy from his turmoil and allowed the DeNas family to escape from Mars forever.
117,Ash,It is unknown why Ash went against the schools doctrine.
118,Ash,However it is known that not even the Scorias senior members were spared from their idol during The Collapse.

287,Ash,Attempting to use Blade Storm against another player when fighting in the Dojo will cause Ash to become invincible and hover in the air.
288,Ash,In this state Ash can only move and use firearms.
289,Ash,When Ash has no melee weapon equipped it is possible in some cases for Ash to attain an unmodded Skana after using Bladestorm.
290,Ash,This Skana is not listed in the end of mission screen nor in the ingame gear list and is lost upon dying or completion of the mission.
291,Ash,When used on a Crewship during Railjack missions and using teleport to join the fray Ash can grow x in size and will be too large to move around not only the Crewship but also the Railjack.

296,Ash,SemiCloak Option GlowCloak Optionl An alternate opaque glow for when the Warframe is cloaked.
297,Ash,Does not alter enemy perception.
298,Ash,Invisibility colorization is affected by the primary Energy color of your Warframe.
299,Ash,Base vs Final Stats in Modding Health Energy Shield Armor Stat Overhaul If youve spent any time invested in the deeper nuances of Modding you may be familiar with Warframe Math math that upon first glance doesnt really make sense but once you learn the inner workings of the game it all comes together.
300,Ash,While we can appreciate the value that complex systems offer to a certain subsect of players there are other aspects of the game that should have clear and understandable outcomes.
301,Ash,Namely Shield Health Energy and Armor Modding.
302,Ash,Pop quiz what is If you answered you may just be an Excalibur player.
303,Ash,Vitality Heath Redirection Shields Flow Energy and Steel Fiber Armor come with large modifier values that dont seem to match their outcome ingame.
304,Ash,This is because these Mods apply their multiplier to the base stats of the Warframe i.e. the stats you have at Rank .
305,Ash,In the Excalibur example a Rank Excaliburs Health stat of earns an additional Health from max rank Vitality Heath since it applies to his base rank Health stat of resulting in total health.
306,Ash,Continuing our Excalibur example instead of Vitality always applying to Excaliburs base rank Health it would apply to his Health stat based on his rank namely the stat you can actually see in your Arsenal.
307,Ash,If your Excalibur were Rank his Health stat would be which means Vitalitys multiplier would be calculated off of .
308,Ash,With previous Health and Mod values additional adjustments are needed to make this revision work while maintaining game balance.
309,Ash,By only changing where the multiplier applies a Rank Excalibur would receive an extra Health from max rank Vitality resulting in a total health stat of .
310,Ash,To remedy this we approached this problem in two ways We reduced the overall multiplier for Health Shield Energy and Armor Mods.
311,Ash,Since these now affect Max Rank Warframe stats these Mods need to scale differently to maintain the status quo.
312,Ash,Doing some quick math this means that a Rank Excalibur Health with a reworked Vitality Mod Health applied to the final Health stat would receive extra Health for a total of .
313,Ash,That in contrast is a nerf which we also dont want to do.
314,Ash,With Health from a max Vitality Mod his resulting Health stat would be which matches what it was originally.
315,Ash,While this path to the same result may seem a little complicated the outcome matches our intention we want players to be able to look at their Health Shield and Armor Mods and be able to understand how they affect the stats they see in their Arsenal.
316,Ash,In addition to everything above we also increased the base stat values for Warframes so that these revised Mods offer similar value for lowerranked Frames.
317,Ash,To do so we reduced the amount of HealthShieldEnergy that Warframes earn per rank in half and transferred the sum of that value to their base stats.
318,Ash,For Armor this is the one stat that does not increase with your Warframes level with some exceptions.
319,Ash,Armor values across the board have been slightly increased to compensate for the Mod changes.
320,Ash,Not to beat a dead Kaithe but Mods will now be applying to the Max Rank stat instead of the Base Rank.
321,Ash,You may look at these numbers and think nerf or buff depending but the outcome is that total Modded values are the same if not a little higher in some cases.
322,Ash,Warframe Stat Changes ASH Health Base Rank from Max Rank from Shields Base Rank from Max Rank from Armor Base Rank from Energy Base Rank from Max Rank from ASH PRIME Health Base Rank from Max Rank from Shields Base Rank from Max Rank from Armor Base Rank from Energy Base Rank from Max Rank from While there may be significant changes to Warframe Stats and Mod values as a part of this overhaul the end result is that your Builds should mostly stay the same.
323,Ash,The key difference is the added clarity of what your Health Shield Energy Armor Mods do in your Upgrade screens Changes Ash can now cast Teleport on Defense objectives.
324,Ash,RAILJACK QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES ASH While maintaining our original intentions to connect Railjack to some more core Warframe style rewards weve made a few changes to have Ash components be more new player friendly for those starting their Railjack journey.

333,Ash,Energy is consumed once per target marked instead of per mark now.
334,Ash,Xoris Interaction Changes Certain Warframe Abilities and Exalted weapons will now reset the Melee Combo Counter only if the Xoris is being used.
335,Ash,The overwhelming Damage output of certain Warframe Abilities was not our intention with an infinite Melee Combo weapon and the conversation of Xoris or youre doing it wrong is greatly restrictive in terms of player choice.

600,Octavia,Base vs Final Stats in Modding Health Energy Shield Armor Stat Overhaul If youve spent any time invested in the deeper nuances of Modding you may be familiar with Warframe Math math that upon first glance doesnt really make sense but once you learn the inner workings of the game it all comes together.
601,Octavia,While we can appreciate the value that complex systems offer to a certain subsect of players there are other aspects of the game that should have clear and understandable outcomes.
602,Octavia,Namely Shield Health Energy and Armor Modding.
603,Octavia,Pop quiz what is If you answered you may just be an Excalibur player.
604,Octavia,Vitality Heath Redirection Shields Flow Energy and Steel Fiber Armor come with large modifier values that dont seem to match their outcome ingame.
605,Octavia,This is because these Mods apply their multiplier to the base stats of the Warframe i.e. the stats you have at Rank .
606,Octavia,In the Excalibur example a Rank Excaliburs Health stat of earns an additional Health from max rank Vitality Heath since it applies to his base rank Health stat of resulting in total health.
607,Octavia,Continuing our Excalibur example instead of Vitality always applying to Excaliburs base rank Health it would apply to his Health stat based on his rank namely the stat you can actually see in your Arsenal.
608,Octavia,If your Excalibur were Rank his Health stat would be which means Vitalitys multiplier would be calculated off of .
609,Octavia,With previous Health and Mod values additional adjustments are needed to make this revision work while maintaining game balance.
610,Octavia,By only changing where the multiplier applies a Rank Excalibur would receive an extra Health from max rank Vitality resulting in a total health stat of .
611,Octavia,To remedy this we approached this problem in two ways We reduced the overall multiplier for Health Shield Energy and Armor Mods.
612,Octavia,Since these now affect Max Rank Warframe stats these Mods need to scale differently to maintain the status quo.
613,Octavia,Doing some quick math this means that a Rank Excalibur Health with a reworked Vitality Mod Health applied to the final Health stat would receive extra Health for a total of .
614,Octavia,That in contrast is a nerf which we also dont want to do.
615,Octavia,With Health from a max Vitality Mod his resulting Health stat would be which matches what it was originally.
616,Octavia,While this path to the same result may seem a little complicated the outcome matches our intention we want players to be able to look at their Health Shield and Armor Mods and be able to understand how they affect the stats they see in their Arsenal.
617,Octavia,In addition to everything above we also increased the base stat values for Warframes so that these revised Mods offer similar value for lowerranked Frames.
618,Octavia,To do so we reduced the amount of HealthShieldEnergy that Warframes earn per rank in half and transferred the sum of that value to their base stats.
619,Octavia,For Armor this is the one stat that does not increase with your Warframes level with some exceptions.
620,Octavia,Armor values across the board have been slightly increased to compensate for the Mod changes.
621,Octavia,Not to beat a dead Kaithe but Mods will now be applying to the Max Rank stat instead of the Base Rank.
622,Octavia,You may look at these numbers and think nerf or buff depending but the outcome is that total Modded values are the same if not a little higher in some cases.
623,Octavia,Warframe Stat Changes OCTAVIA Health Base Rank from Max Rank from Shields Base Rank from Max Rank from Armor Base Rank from Energy Base Rank from Max Rank from OCTAVIA PRIME Health Base Rank from Max Rank from Shields Base Rank from Max Rank from Armor Base Rank from Energy Base Rank from Max Rank from While there may be significant changes to Warframe Stats and Mod values as a part of this overhaul the end result is that your Builds should mostly stay the same.
